# Password Handler

Password Handler is a C language project that allows you to securely store passwords in encrypted form within a text file and provides functionality to retrieve 
passwords and display the names of websites that are present in text file in a sorted manner. It utilizes a static library for encryption and sorting operations. While running the program it also ask for authentication, so that security of the password can be ensured. 

## Need of Password Handler and Story behind making this project

As we all know that in today's world we make hundreds of digial accounts on different platforms and we have to remember them. But it is difficult to remember hundreds of different passwords. And also we can't use same password for every website we sign up because if anybody gets the password of one site then he or she has access of all the websites you have signed up with same password. By using this password handler you are able to store your passwords on one place. Moreover, the security of your passwords are ensured in two way that are, first any one using this application firstly have to authenticate and then he or she can access the passwords. Second the passwords of websites are stored in COMPLEX encrypted form.
